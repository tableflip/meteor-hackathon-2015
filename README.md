**The London node of a global, 24 hour hackathon, for meteor apps of note**

- http://meteor-2015.devpost.com/

Most important:
- Have fun.
- Learn a thing.
- Meet others who are also learning a thing.

Less important:
- Win hackathon^


^ if you are determined to win hackathon, then, from the hackathon guidelines, you will need:

- Be in a team of 1-4 (3 would be ideal for our office)
- A github repo with app code
- A demo video not to exceed 1:30
- A list of packages used to create the app
- Build a thing that will be judged on the vague criteria of _"Impresiveness"_ & _"Technical Difficulty"_
- Tweeting #builtwithmeteor! may help.

But honestly, all that sounds like madness. We're here to help you learn, play, and hopefully make something you're happy with.
